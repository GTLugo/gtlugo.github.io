I am a software engineer specializing in systems programming and API development.

My favorite thing about API development is creating easy, intuitive designs for developers to use, such as in my Rust crate “Witer.” It takes the older, error-prone Win32 API and redesigns it to be safer and more idiomatic for Rust.

Additionally, I enjoy game architecture and design. Over the years, I’ve written a number of game engine prototypes in C++ and Rust. Of particular interest to me are the rendering and ECS components of game engine design.

Some of my other hobbies also include anime & manga (I love *DanMachi* and *No Game No Life*), vtubers (*FUWAMOCO* are so much fun), and biking.
